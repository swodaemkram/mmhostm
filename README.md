Mattermost Host monitor

This software will be a small service written in C++ that will monitor a list of host by pinging them at first but eventually
I will have it do a http:// GET or POST to verify a host is allive and if the host does not respond it will send a message
to a certin channel on my mattermost server to alert me.

(I use mattermost for everything)
